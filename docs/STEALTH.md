# Stealth notes (practical)

"Stealth" is contextual. This tool tries to be **less noisy** by default, but you should still assume it can be detected.

Recommended:
- Start with `--passive`
- Disable brute with `--no-brute` when necessary
- Keep `--active` for authorized pentests and approved windows
- Consider dedicated resolvers and egress controls for engagements
